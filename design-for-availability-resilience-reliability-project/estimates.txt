1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage: 
- In a Multi-AZ deployment, the RTO for a single Availability Zone (AZ) outage can typically be 
around 5 to 30 minutes. This is due to the automated failover mechanisms that AWS provides, 
which allow the system to quickly switch to the standby database in another AZ, minimizing 
downtime.

2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage: 
- For a single region outage, the RTO can extend to approximately 1 to 2 hours, depending on 
the complexity of the recovery process and the configurations in place. This includes the time 
required to promote a read replica in another region to primary status and redirect traffic 
accordingly.

3. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage: 
- The RPO for a single AZ outage is generally very low, often between 0 and 5 minutes. 
This is because the data is continuously replicated to the standby database in another AZ, 
ensuring minimal data loss.

4. Minimum RPO for a single region outage: In the case of a single region outage, 
the RPO can range from 10 minutes to several hours. This is contingent upon the replication 
strategy employed, such as asynchronous replication to a read replica in another region, 
which may result in some data loss depending on the last successful replication point before 
the outage occurred.
