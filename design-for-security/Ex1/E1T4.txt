Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
For the VPC configuration, all of the route definitions have CIDR defined as 0.0.0.0/0.

An attacker can direclty steal information from the application and tranfer it into any IP within the VPC
With all port exposed, maybe an attacker can DOS the server

# Poor practice 2
IAM Role has full access to any objects in s3.
Violation of least privilege principle
