Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.
1. Encryption and logging are essentials for S3. And also CloudTrail need to be specified when an API 
invoked for an object in S3.
2. Security Group allows all traffic from internet
3. Port 5000 is reachable from application, even port 23 with stand for Telnet port and port 20, 21 stand 
for FTP also is exposed 
4. If an application include sensitive information need to config for HTTPS rediections
5. IAM policy violate at least principle

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
1. The use of non-root account need to be enforced.
2. Set IAM policies for at least principle
3. Enable encryption and logging for S3. Especially, CloudTrail for tracking, it allows us for additional
auditing and monitoring layer
4. Enable VPC flow logging
5. Close unnecessary port
6. Remove public access for EC2
